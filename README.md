# The book lover survey

The site is a simple survey about books and reading. It's the first project I built using React state. It was built as an exercise during the Technigo bootcamp for frontend developers in fall 2020.

## What you'll find in the code

I built the site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript React. It consists of severals components for the different questions, header, footer and a summary that is shown to the user after submitting answers to all the questions. 
The site is accessible and tested for screen readers with the Chrome extension Chrome Vox. Cross browser testing was done on Chrome, Edge and Firefox.
